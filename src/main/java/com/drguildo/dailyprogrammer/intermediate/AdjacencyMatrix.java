/*
 * In graph theory, an adjacency matrix is a data structure that can represent
 * the edges between nodes for a graph in an N x N matrix. The basic idea is
 * that an edge exists between the elements of a row and column if the entry at
 * that point is set to a valid value. This data structure can also represent
 * either a directed graph or an undirected graph, since you can read the rows
 * as being "source" nodes, and columns as being the "destination" (or
 * vice-versa).
 * 
 * Your goal is to write a program that takes in a list of edge-node
 * relationships, and print a directed adjacency matrix for it. Our convention
 * will follow that rows point to columns. Follow the examples for clarification
 * of this convention.
